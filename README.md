# 18 Social Network API

## Description

Using MondoDB and Mongoose, I created a social network backend -- the usability of the API can be demo'd on Thunder Client. When a user is added to the database, their username and/or email can be updated, or deleted atogether.

When I create a "thought", it is tied to a specific user and it can then be edited or deleted. "Reactions" can also be added and deleted from thoughts.

The last piecec of functionality is adding and removing friends. I can add or delete friends from a user while keeping the users in my database.
